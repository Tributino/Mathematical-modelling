# Mathematical-modelling

## About this Project

The purpose of this project is to present the Mathematical Modelling, the process of developing a mathematical model. Mathematics is a precise language that helps us formulate ideas and identify underlying assumptions. In other words, a mathematical model is an excellent tool to explain a system, study the effects of different components, and make predictions about behaviour.
